...

ADMIN_PATH_PREFIX=/~AdminER21
```
Admin folder is defined throught constant ADMIN_PATH_PREFIX to hide/secure admin folder from public access in production

4. Install composer packages. It wont be neccessary to perform this installation on PHP container
```bash
$ composer install
```

5. Update files and directories permission and ownership
```bash
$ sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
$ sudo find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
$ sudo chown -R $USER:www-data .
$ sudo chgrp -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache
$ sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache
```

```bash
$ php artisan cache:clear
$ php artisan config:clear
$ composer dump-autoload
```

6. Create and start the containers
```bash
$ make run
```

7. Generate Laravel key *this will automatically log into php container and then log out*
```bash
$ make generate-key
```

6. Get into the database container as root user
```bash
$ make ssh-db-root
```

```bash
$ mysql -h localhost -u root -p -e "create database squareone default character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;"
```
